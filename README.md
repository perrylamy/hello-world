# hello-world
Initial repository to store my projects and interests.
This is the initiation of my venture into the open source world.  I am interested in programming and computer science (albeit with a dated M.S. in Comp Sci from the U of Idaho, 1987) but also interested in genealogy which has a similar evolution in developing a hypothesis, proving/disproving it, and then incorporating into the "master" line.
There is also an exploding technology in terms of using DNA for genealogical research that requires software tools to manage and exploit the data provided by atDNA testing.
My question -- Can software development tools be adapted to genealogy research and use of DNA as a research tool??
